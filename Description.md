This project involves the analysis of a dataset related to Andhra Pradesh, focusing on predictive modeling using linear regression. The primary goal is to train a regression model to predict the 'Town Code' based on features such as 'ST Code,' 'DT Code,' and 'SDT Code.' The project includes preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load the dataset using pandas.
Encode non-numeric columns using LabelEncoder.
Define features ('ST Code,' 'DT Code,' 'SDT Code') and target ('Town Code').

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use pair plots, heatmaps, and descriptive statistics to understand the data.

3. Data Splitting:
Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

4. Model Training:
Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression.

5. Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Visualize performance metrics and model predictions.

6. SHAP Analysis:
Perform SHAP analysis to explain feature importance.

7. Visualization:
Create plots for training vs. validation metrics, data distribution, feature importance, and evaluation metrics.
