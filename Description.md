This project applies a machine learning approach to analyze a dataset related to towns in Andhra Pradesh, India. The Linear Regression model is utilized to predict the town codes based on district codes and related identifiers. Various evaluation metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis, are used to assess the model's performance. The project also incorporates extensive visualizations to understand feature relationships, model behavior, and prediction outcomes.

Source: The dataset represents administrative data from Andhra Pradesh, India, and is provided as a CSV file.
Structure:
Columns include ST, DT, SDT Code, and Town.
Non-numeric columns are encoded using Label Encoding to make them suitable for machine-learning algorithms.
Use Case: Predict the Town Code using related feature columns.

1. Data Preprocessing: Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder.Visualize feature distributions and relationships with Seaborn pair plots.
2. Model Selection and Training: Select Linear Regression as the predictive model. Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%)subsets.
3. Model Evaluation: Calculate MSE, R², and F1-score metrics. Analyze model behavior with visualizations, including R² comparisons, true vs. predicted value distributions, and confusion matrices.
4. Feature Importance Analysis: Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions.
5. Result Visualization: Generate plots for accuracy, loss curves, and false positive rates across prediction bins.
